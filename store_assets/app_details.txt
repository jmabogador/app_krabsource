KrabSource is a mobile application designed to identify, classify, and monitor crab species found on Panay Island, Philippines. Powered by Convolutional Neural Networks (ResNet-18), the system provides a fast and reliable way to recognize crabs based on their color, shape, and texture patterns, while also mapping their locations using GPS.

With KrabSource, users can easily capture or upload a photo of a crab, and the app will instantly analyze the image to determine its species.
